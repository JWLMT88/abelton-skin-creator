## Notes

Preview is open to discussion I have 3 options for this as I see it

1. I recreate the whole UI or a facsimile of it in SVGs and then I can update the colour as I see fit. (Huge effort)
2. I take screenshots of each variation and turn those into luminence mattes where I can update the color. (slightly less but still alot of work)
3. I take screenshots and annotate which parts will be updated. (Still a bit of work but much less than the other two)
